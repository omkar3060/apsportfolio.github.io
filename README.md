## Introduction

  Ola is a leading ride-hailing service, providing a platform for booking rides conveniently and efficiently. In today’s day and age, the efficiency and effectiveness of ride-hailing services can be significantly enhanced through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio project delves into the core functionalities of Ola’s diverse services, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired from the course Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS). By using advanced algorithmic techniques and data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business applications. From optimizing ride allocation algorithms for improved efficiency and speed to enhancing route planning for better accuracy and reduced travel time, the potential for enhancement is vast.

  This portfolio showcases how algorithms can be applied within Ola’s ecosystem. Each use case illustrates how specific DSA principles can solve practical challenges faced by a ride-hailing service like Ola, bridging the gap between theory and application. Explore the use cases to see how DSA and Algorithmic Problem Solving techniques are used to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency in a real-world context.

## Need of Portfolio

The ever-evolving landscape of ride-hailing services necessitates continual improvements in service management and user experience. Ola, as a leading player in this industry, faces various operational challenges that can be addressed through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio is essential for several reasons. Firstly, optimizing service efficiency is crucial; efficient ride allocation and route planning can minimize wait times and maximize resource utilization. By exploring advanced algorithmic solutions, this portfolio aims to enhance these processes, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient service. Additionally, the transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application is a critical step in the learning process. This portfolio provides an opportunity to apply concepts learned in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses to real-world problems, thereby solidifying understanding and skills.

## Objectives

**1.** Apply theoretical concepts from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses to practical, real-world problems within the Ola platform.

**2.** Address specific business challenges faced by Ola through the application of algorithmic problem-solving.

**3.** Explore and implement algorithmic solutions that ensure streamlined and efficient services within Ola’s ecosystem.

## Data Structures and Algorithms applicable

### 1. **Shortest Path Algorithms**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**: 
- Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to compute the shortest path from a driver's current location to the passenger's pickup point and from there to the destination. This ensures that the driver takes the most efficient route, reducing travel time and fuel consumption.

- As traffic conditions change, Dijkstra's algorithm can be re-run to adjust routes dynamically. This helps in avoiding congested areas and finding the quickest path based on current traffic data.

- For rides with multiple drop-off points (e.g., carpooling services), Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to determine the optimal sequence of drop-offs to minimize total travel distance or time.

  **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:

- The Bellman-Ford algorithm is well-suited for graphs with dynamically changing weights, such as those caused by real-time traffic conditions. For Ola, Bellman-Ford can be used to periodically update the shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes, taking into account current traffic data.

- Additionally, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weight edges, which can represent road segments with varying conditions (e.g., roadworks or traffic jams that effectively "slow down" the route).

  
**Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:

- The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is ideal for precomputing the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. For the Ola platform, this could be used to maintain a database of precomputed shortest routes between various points in a city.

- When a ride request is made, the system can quickly reference this database to provide the optimal route, ensuring faster response times and improved efficiency.

  
### 2. **Assignment Problem**

- **Scheduling and Shift Management**: The Assignment Problem can be applied to create optimal schedules for drivers, ensuring that there are always enough drivers available to meet demand at different times of the day.

- **Driver-Passenger Matching**: By treating each ride request and available driver as tasks and agents, respectively, the Assignment Problem can be used to minimize the total cost, which is a combination of factors such as waiting time, travel distance, previously given ratings by the passenger to the driver and fuel consumption. The goal is to match each passenger with the most suitable driver.

### 3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** 

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: The LCS algorithm can be used to find common phrases or sentiments in customer feedback. By identifying the longest common subsequences in customer reviews, Ola can detect recurring issues or popular features or even spams, helping to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.

- **Driver Performance Monitoring**: The LCS algorithm can be applied to analyze historical trip data to find common routes taken by multiple drivers. By identifying these frequently traveled paths, Ola can optimize routing algorithms to suggest the most efficient routes, reducing travel time and fuel consumption.

  ### 4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

- **Efficiently Managing Driver and Ride Data**: BSTs can be used to manage data related to drivers and rides in a way that allows for quick insertions, deletions, and lookups. For instance, driver ratings, ride prices, and trip durations can be stored in BSTs to facilitate fast access and updates. This is particularly useful for operations that need sorted data.
 
  ### 5. **Red-Black Trees**

- **Efficient Operations**: Ride-hailing platforms experience high-frequency transactions, including new ride bookings, driver status updates, and user feedback submissions. Red-Black Trees allow for quick insertions and deletions while maintaining balance, ensuring that the indices remain efficient and up-to-date.
