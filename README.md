## Introduction

  Ola is a leading ride-hailing service, providing a platform for booking rides conveniently and efficiently. In today’s day and age, the efficiency and effectiveness of ride-hailing services can be significantly enhanced through the strategic application of data structures and algorithms. This portfolio project delves into the core functionalities of Ola’s diverse services, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired from the course Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS). By using advanced algorithmic techniques and data structures, this project aims to propose solutions to real-world business applications. From optimizing ride allocation algorithms for improved efficiency and speed to enhancing route planning for better accuracy and reduced travel time, the potential for enhancement is vast.

  This portfolio showcases how algorithms can be applied within Ola’s ecosystem. Each use case illustrates how specific DSA principles can solve practical challenges faced by a ride-hailing service like Ola, bridging the gap between theory and application. Explore the use cases to see how DSA and Algorithmic Problem Solving techniques are used to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency in a real-world context.
